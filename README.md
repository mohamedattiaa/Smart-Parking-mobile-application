# Smart Parking Project

## Overview
The Smart Parking Project is an Android-based mobile application designed to address common urban parking challenges by automating parking spot management. This solution utilizes modern technologies to enhance user convenience and improve parking efficiency in busy urban settings.

## Features
- **Real-Time Parking Availability**: Displays the status of each parking spot with LED indicators:
  - Green: Free
  - Red: Occupied
  - Yellow: Reserved
- **Automated Vehicle Entry and Exit**: Uses RFID technology and Raspberry Pi for seamless vehicle detection and spot monitoring.
- **Reservation System**: Allows users to locate, reserve, and manage parking spaces easily.
- **Secure Payment Integration**: Calculates parking fees based on time spent and manages transactions securely with Firebase.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Kotlin** and **Android** for the mobile application
- **Firebase** for database management and transaction handling
- **RFID** and **Raspberry Pi** for vehicle tracking and monitoring
